10.	Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to sort an array of elements by dividing the array into two subarrays and combining these subarrays after sorting each one of them. Your program should also find number of comparisons and inversions during sorting the array.

11.	Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to sort an array of elements by partitioning the array into two subarrays based on a pivot element such that one of the sub arrays holds values smaller than the pivot element while another sub array holds values greater than the pivot element. Pivot element should be selected randomly from the array. Your program should also find number of comparisons and swaps required for sorting the array.
