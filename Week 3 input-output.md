7.	Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and a program to sort the array using insertion sort. Your program should be able to find number of comparisons and shifts ( shifts- total number of times the array elements are shifted from their place) required for sorting the array.

8.	Given an unsorted array of integers, design an algorithm and implement a program to sort this array using selection sort. Your program should also find number of comparisons and number of swaps required.

9.	Given an unsorted array of positive integers, design an algorithm and implement it using a program to find whether there are any duplicate elements in the array or not. (use sorting) (Time Complexity = O(n log n)).
